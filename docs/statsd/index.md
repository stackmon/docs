# Statsd

Statsd is a network daemon that runs on the Node.js platform and listens for
statistics, like counters and timers, sent over UDP or TCP and sends aggregates
to one or more pluggable backend services (e.g., Graphite). In StacMon statsd
collects API HTTP requests metrics metrics from all StacMon components including
ApiMon, EpMon, or any ClodMon plugin.


Statsd is hosted on [github](https://github.com/statsd/statsd).
