# Relational DB

StackMon relies on a relational database for variety of purposes. 

Three independent databases are deployed in Stackmon environment:

 - database for ApiMon monitoring playbooks test results
 - database for Status Dashboard metrics (once status dashboard is enabled)
 - database for Grafana dashboard (once Grafana is managed as part of StackMon)
