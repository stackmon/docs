# Executor

The Executor role of each API-Monitoring environment is responsible for
executing individual jobs (scenarios). Those can be defined as Ansible
playbooks (what allow them to be pretty much anything) or any other executable
form (as python script). The scenarios are collected in a Git repository and
updated in real-time. In general mentioned test jobs do not need take care of
generating data implicitly. Since the API related tasks in the playbooks rely
on the Python OpenStack SDK (and its OTC extensions), metric data generated
automatically by a logging interface of the SDK ('openstack_api' metrics).

Additionall metric data are generated also by executor service which collects
the playbook names, results and duration time ('ansible_stats' metrics). This
mechanism can be augmented by other sources and formats.

The Executor python code is hosted on
[github](https://github.com/stackmon/apimon/tree/main/apimon/executor).
The playbooks with monitoring scenarios are stored in separete repository on
[github](https://github.com/stackmon/apimon-tests). Playbooks
address the most common use cases with cloud services conducted by end
customers.

The metrics generated by Executor are describe on [metrics](metrics.md) page.
