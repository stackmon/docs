# Executor

The Executor role of each API-Monitoring environment is responsible for
executing individual jobs defined as Ansible playbooks collected from an
external repository. The scenarios are collected in a Git repository and updated
in real-time. In general the playbooks do not need take care of generating data
implicitly. Since the API related tasks in the playbooks rely on the Python
OpenStack SDK (and its OTC extensions), metric data generated automatically by a
logging interface of the SDK ('openstack_api' metrics).

Additionally metric data are generated also by executor service which collects
the playbook names, results and duration time ('ansible_stats' metrics). This
mechanism can be augmented by other sources and formats.

The Executor python code is hosted on
[github](https://github.com/stackmon/apimon/tree/main/apimon/executor).
The playbooks with monitoring scenarios are stored in separete repository on
[github](https://github.com/opentelekomcloud-infra/apimon-tests). Playbooks
address the most common use cases with cloud services conducted by end
customers.

The metrics generated by Executor are describe on [metrics](metrics.md) page.
