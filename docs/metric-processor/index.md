# Metrics processor

When monitoring cloud it is not unusual to have a variety of metrics types
(latencies, status codes, rates). Visualizing overall state of the service based
on those metrics is not an easy task in this case. It is desired to have
something like a semaphore to visualize overall "health" of the component (green
- up and running, yellow - there are some issues, red - complete outage).
Depending on the used TSDB there might be no way to do this at all.

metrics-processor is there to address 2 primary needs:

 - convert series of raw metrics of different types into single semaphore-like
    metric
 - inform status dashboard once certain component status is not healthy.
